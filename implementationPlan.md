# Implementation Plan: File Creation Mutation

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to implement a mutation that allows creating new files in the managed object storage system.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Schema Updates

- Add new mutation type in `server/src/schema/mutations.graphql`:
  ```graphql
  type Mutation {
    createFile(name: String!, content: String!): File!
  }
  ```

### 2. Type Definitions

- Ensure File type exists in schema with necessary fields:
  ```graphql
  type File {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    content: String!
  }
  ```

### 3. Resolver Implementation

- Create new resolver in `server/src/resolvers/mutations.ts`:
  - Implement `createFile` mutation resolver
  - The resolver is simply a no-op or a loopback. No actual file creation needs to happen at this point.
